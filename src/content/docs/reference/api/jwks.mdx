title: JWKS endpoints
sidebar:
  order: 2
---

These two endpoints are used to retrieve the public keys to verify any access `token` issued by our authorization server (iss=nopwd.io).

Nopwd uses the JSON Web Key (JWK) specification to represent the cryptographic keys used for signing P256 tokens. This specification defines two high-level data structures: JSON Web Key (JWK) and JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)
Public key is in [the JWKS Format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) so you can verify the signature for all generated access `token`.

| Method | Ressources      | Purpose                               |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| GET    | **/jwks/\:kid** | Returns a specific JSON Web Key (JWK) |
| GET    | **/jwks**       | Returns a set of JSON Web Key (JWK)   |

:::tip[Signing keys rotation]
Nopwd signs with only one signing key at a time but we performing key rotation for security reasons. As your `access_token` could be signed just before our key rotation, we must let you access the previous one using these two endpoints.
:::

## GET /jwks/\:kid

Returns a JWK identified by its `kid`.

### Parameters

| Param  | Type | Mandatory | Description                                          |
| ------ | ---- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `:kid` | Path | Yes       | represents the unique identifier for the signing key |

:::tip[How to retrieve the jwk kid?]
You can get the signing key's `kid` used to sign any of our access `token` from its JWT Header (`kid` parameter).
:::

### Response

```ts
interface Jwk {
  kid: string; // The unique identifier for the key
  kty: string; // The family of cryptographic algorithms used with the key (we are using EC)
  crv: string; // we are using "P-256"
  x: string; // the x coordinate of the elliptic Curve (base64 url safe)
  y: string; // the y coordinate of the elliptic Curve (base64 url safe)
}
```

### Response Codes

| Code | Description                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | You did great.                              |
| 404  | This key doesn't exist or has been revoked. |

### Usage

```ts
const response = await fetch(`https://api.nopwd.io/v1/jwks/${kid}`);
const jwk = await response.json();
```

## GET /jwks

Returns all valid JSON Web Keys (JWK).

### Response

```ts
interface Jwks extends Array<Jwk> {}
```

### Response Codes

| Code | Description    |
| ---- | -------------- |
| 200  | You did great. |

### Usage

```ts
const response = await fetch("https://api.nopwd.io/v1/jwks");
const jwks = await response.json();
```
