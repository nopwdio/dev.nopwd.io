title: JWKS Endpoints
sidebar:
  order: 2
---

These endpoints allow you to retrieve the public keys needed to verify any access `token` issued by our authorization server (iss=nopwd.io).

Nopwd uses the JSON Web Key (JWK) specification to represent the cryptographic keys used for signing P256 tokens. This specification defines two high-level data structures: JSON Web Key (JWK) and JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). The public key is in [the JWKS Format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517), enabling you to verify the signature of all generated access `tokens`.

| Method | Resource        | Purpose                               |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| GET    | **/jwks/\:kid** | Returns a specific JSON Web Key (JWK) |
| GET    | **/jwks**       | Returns a set of JSON Web Keys (JWKS) |

:::tip[Signing Keys Rotation]
Nopwd uses only one signing key at a time but performs key rotation for security reasons. Since your `access_token` could be signed just before a key rotation, we provide access to the previous key using these endpoints.
:::

## GET /jwks/\:kid

Returns a JWK identified by its `kid`.

### Parameters

| Param  | Type | Mandatory | Description                                          |
| ------ | ---- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `:kid` | Path | Yes       | The unique identifier for the signing key            |

:::tip[How to Retrieve the JWK Kid?]
You can find the signing key's `kid` used to sign any of our access `tokens` in the JWT Header (`kid` parameter).
:::

### Response

```ts
interface Jwk {
  kid: string; // The unique identifier for the key
  kty: string; // The family of cryptographic algorithms used with the key (we use EC)
  crv: string; // The curve used, which is "P-256"
  x: string; // The x coordinate of the elliptic curve (base64 url safe)
  y: string; // The y coordinate of the elliptic curve (base64 url safe)
}
```

### Response Codes

| Code | Description                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | Request was successful.                     |
| 404  | The key doesn't exist or has been revoked.  |

### Usage

```ts
const response = await fetch(`https://api.nopwd.io/v0/jwks/${kid}`);
const jwk = await response.json();
```

## GET /jwks

Returns all valid JSON Web Keys (JWKs).

### Response

```ts
interface Jwks {
  keys: Jwk[]
}
```

### Response Codes

| Code | Description    |
| ---- | -------------- |
| 200  | Request was successful. |

### Usage

```ts
const response = await fetch("https://api.nopwd.io/v0/jwks");
const jwks = await response.json();
```
