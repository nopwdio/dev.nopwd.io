## API Base URL

All endpoints are located at `https://api.nopwd.io/:version` and generally follow REST architecture principles.

The current version is `v0`.

:::tip[encoding]
All requests must be encoded as JSON with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. Unless otherwise specified, responses from the NoPwd API, including errors, are also encoded exclusively as JSON.

## Managing Errors

### Error Codes

NoPwd uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error due to the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted or malformed). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with NoPwd's servers (these are rare).

All error responses follow this format:

```ts
{
  error: "The attribute 'email' is missing", // A short description of the issue
}
```

Some errors (such as 429) may include additional parameters (see the Rate Limits section).

### Rate Limits

The NoPwd API employs several safeguards against bursts of incoming traffic to help maintain stability. Users who send many requests in quick succession may receive error responses with status code 429.

```ts
{
  error: "slow down", // A short description of the issue
  retry_at: 408430500, // Unix timestamp indicating when to retry.
}
```
