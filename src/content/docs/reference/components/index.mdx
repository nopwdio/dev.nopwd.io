## How to Install

You can load our web components via CDN or install them locally using a package manager like NPM.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Using CDN">
Each component (`np-login`, `np-passkey-register`, `np-logout`, `np-if`) can be loaded individually from a CDN.

Example using the email link authentication button component:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nopwdio/sdk-js@latest/cdn/components/{component-name}.js"
></script>
```


:::tip[Version Management]
It is not recommended to use the `@latest` suffix, as a major release could break your application.
Instead, use a fixed version such as `X.Y.Z`.
:::

Since modules are loaded asynchronously, the component may not be available during the initial render, causing a Flash of Undefined Custom Elements (FOUCE) when the page loads.

**How to Prevent FOUCE**

One option is to use the `:defined` CSS pseudo-class to hide custom elements that havenâ€™t been registered yet.

```css
np-login:not(:defined) {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

Another option is to use the `customElements.whenDefined()` function, which returns a promise that resolves when the specified element is registered.
You can then add a specific class to adjust the CSS accordingly.

```js
await customElements.whenDefined("np-login");
document.body.classList.add("ready");
```

If you prefer not to use the CDN, you can install the latest version of our SDK from npm with the following command:
```sh
npm i @nopwdio/sdk-js@latest
```

Once installed, simply import the desired component:

```js
import "@nopwdio/sdk-js/dist/components/{component-name}.js";
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## CDN vs NPM

TL;DR:
Use `@nopwdio/sdk-js/cdn` for CDN and `@nopwdio/sdk-js/dist` for NPM.

CDN links start with `/cdn` and npm imports use `/dist`.
The `/cdn` files are pre-bundled and minified, with code splitting for optimal bandwidth usage.
The `/dist` files are not pre-bundled, allowing your bundler to efficiently deduplicate dependencies, resulting in smaller bundles and optimal code sharing.
