You can load our web components via CDN or by installing it locally.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Code } from "astro:components";
import { cdn, npmInstall, npmImport } from "../../../../assets/snippet.js";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="using CDN">
    Each components (`np-email-signin`, `np-passkey-register`, `np-passkey-signin`) can be loaded individualy from a CDN.

    Exemple using the email link authentication button component:
    <Code code={cdn} lang="html"/>

    Easy right?

:::tip[About version management]
It is not recommended to use the `@latest` suffix, as a major release could break your application. Instead, use a fixed version such as `0.3.2`.

  <TabItem label="using NPM">
  If you donâ€™t want to use the CDN, you can install the latest version of our sdk from npm with the following command.
  <Code code={npmInstall} lang="sh"/>

Once installed, you only have to import the desired component and you are good to go.

  <Code code={npmImport} lang="js"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
