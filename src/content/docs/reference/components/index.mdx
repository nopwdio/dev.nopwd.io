## How to install it?

You can load our web components via CDN or by installing it locally.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="using NPM">
If you don’t want to use the CDN, you can install the latest version of our sdk from npm with the following command.
```sh
npm i @nopwdio/sdk-js@latest
```

Once installed, you only have to import the desired component and you are good to go.

```js
import "@nopwdio/sdk-js/dist/components/{component-name}.js";
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="using CDN">
Each components (`np-email-login`, `np-passkey-register`, `np-passkey-login`) can be loaded individualy from a CDN.

Example using the email link authentication button component:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nopwdio/sdk-js@latest/cdn/components/np-email-login.js"
></script>
```

:::tip[About version management]
It is not recommended to use the `@latest` suffix, as a major release could break your application. Instead, use a fixed version such as `0.3.2`.
:::

As module is asynchronous, the component may be not loaded during the first render and
you may notice a Flash of Undefined Custom Elements (FOUCE) when the page loads.

**How to prevent it?**

One option is to use the `:defined` CSS pseudo-class to mask custom elements that haven’t been registered yet.

```css
np-email-login:not(:defined) {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

Another option is to use `customElements.whenDefined()` function, which returns a promise that resolves when the specified element is registered.
You can then add a specific class to adapt the CSS accordingly.

```js
await customElements.whenDefined("np-email-login");
document.body.classList.add("ready");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## The difference between CDN and npm

TL;DR:
`@nopwdio/sdk-js/cdn` is for CDN supporters and `@nopwdio/sdk-js/dist` for NPM lovers.

You’ll notice that the CDN links all start with `/cdn` and npm imports use `/dist`.
The `/cdn` files are pre-bundled, minified. Code splitting is also used for optimal bandwidth optimization.
The /dist files DO NOT come pre-bundled, allowing your bundler of choice to more efficiently deduplicate dependencies, resulting in smaller bundles and optimal code sharing.
