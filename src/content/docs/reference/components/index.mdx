## How to install it?

You can load our web components via CDN or by installing it locally.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="using CDN">
Each components (`np-email-login`, `np-passkey-register`, `np-passkey-login`) can be loaded individualy from a CDN.

Example using the email link authentication button component:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@nopwdio/sdk-js@latest/cdn/components/np-email-login.js"
></script>
```

Easy right?

:::tip[About version management]
It is not recommended to use the `@latest` suffix, as a major release could break your application. Instead, use a fixed version such as `0.3.2`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="using NPM">
If you donâ€™t want to use the CDN, you can install the latest version of our sdk from npm with the following command.
```sh
npm i @nopwdio/sdk@latest
```

Once installed, you only have to import the desired component and you are good to go.

```js
import "@nopwdio/sdk/dist/components/{component-name}.js";
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
