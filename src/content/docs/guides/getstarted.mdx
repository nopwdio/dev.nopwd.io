## What is Nopwd?

Nopwd is a set set of web components to authenticate your users without any password. It allows seamless, fast, and secure way for your user to login or signup.
You don't believe us? [test it and go passwordless!](https://nopwd.rocks)

**no API Key** nor **credit card** required ðŸ•º

## Motivation

Authentication is used to be hard for users but also for developers. At Nopwd, we work hard to keep our API simple and minimal ðŸ’†.

Using Nopwd, you **won't** have to:

- ~~register your app or website~~
- ~~manage any API Key or secrets~~

## Installation

You can load our web components via CDN or by installing it locally.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Code } from "astro:components";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="using CDN">
    You can load every components using individual module compontent:

    Loading individual component:
    <Code
      code={`

<script
  type="module"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@apinet/nopwd-sdk@latest/cdn/components/{component-name}.js"
></script>

;

`}
lang="html"
/>

You can also use import map for better

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="using NPM">
  If you donâ€™t want to use the CDN, you can install the latest version of our sdk from npm with the following command.
  <Code code={`npm i @nopwdio/sdk@latest`} lang="sh"/>

Once installed, you can easily import component

  <Code code={`import "@nopwdio/sdk/dist/components/{component-name}.js";`} lang="js"/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Quickstart

### Send an authentication request

On sign in/up, send an authorization request to the user's mailbox:

```ts
// From login or signin button
await fetch("https://api.nopwd.io/v1/email/requests", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: "user@email.com",
    callback_uri: "https://yourwebsite.com/signin",
  }),
});
```

ðŸ‘† You see, no API Key here :)

Once your user click on the authorization link from its mailbox, he will be redirected back to the specified callback url with a new `code` parameter.

### Get the access token

From your callback page, retrieve the `code` paramater and exchange it to an `access_token`:

```ts
// From your callback page
const response = await fetch("https://api.nopwd.io/v1/email/tokens", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    code: "...", // the code parameter sent back to your callback url
  }),
});
// ...
const data = <Response>await response.json();
// use data.access_token to authenticate your user from your backend
```

### You're done!

Transmit this `access_token` to your backend to create the user session.
