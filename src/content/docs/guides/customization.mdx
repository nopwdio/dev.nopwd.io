Nopwd components can be customized at a high level.
This gives you control over theme colors, general styling and localization.

## Styling

Nopwd uses standard [CSS parts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part) to let you target and styling individual components.

```css
np-email-auth:not([state])::part(button) {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
```

You can also customize every component's state:

```css
np-email-auth[state="requesting"]::part(button) {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: grey;
}
```

## Localization

Override with ease strings for any element to localize to any language or change the wording to match your brand.

```html
<!-- to change the default slot -->
<np-email-auth>Login</np-email-auth>
```

Every single component state is also customizable using named slot:

```html
<np-email-auth>
  <!-- sending an email -->
  <span slot="requesting">Sending email...</span>
  <!-- the email has been sent -->
  <span slot="requested">Check your mailbox!</span>
  <!-- ... -->
</np-email-auth>
```

To prevent unexpected behaviors, please take the time to review the [component reference](/reference/components) explaining all `::part` and `slots` for each of them.
