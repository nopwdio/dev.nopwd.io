## What is Nopwd?

Nopwd is a set of [web components](/reference/components) to authenticate your users using **email link** or **Passkeys** authentication. It allows your user to log in or register seamlessly, quickly and securely. You don't believe us? [test it and go passwordless!](https://nopwd.rocks).

**No API Key** nor **credit card** required ðŸ•º

## Why?

Authentication is used to be hard for users but also for developers. At Nopwd, we work hard to keep our API simple and minimal ðŸ’†.

Using Nopwd, you **won't** have to:

- ~~give us money~~ (but you can still support us ðŸ˜…)
- ~~register your app or website~~
- ~~manage any API Key or secrets~~

## Let's go!

import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Authenticating with email magic-link"
    description="Onboard your users with a one-click email authentication"
    href="/guides/email"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Authenticating with Passkeys"
    description="Delight them with biometric authentication right in the browser"
    href="/guides/passkeys"
