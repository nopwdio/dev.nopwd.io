## What is Nopwd?

Nopwd is a set of [web components](/reference/components) designed to authenticate your users using **email link** or **passkeys** authentication. It allows your users to log in or register seamlessly, quickly, and securely. Don't believe us? [Test it and go passwordless!](https://nopwd.rocks).

**No API Key** nor **credit card** required ðŸ•º

## Why?

Authentication used to be hard for users and developers alike. At Nopwd, we work hard to keep our API simple and minimal ðŸ’†.

Using Nopwd, you **won't** have to:

- **give us money** (but you can still support us ðŸ˜…)
- **register your app or website**
- **manage any API keys or secrets**

## Let's Go!
