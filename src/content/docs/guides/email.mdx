Also known as a magic link, email authentication is a passwordless flow where users click a unique link sent to their email address to log in.

## Integration

From your login page, add the `<np-email-login>` component and set the `email` attribute with your user's email address.

```html
<np-email-login></np-email-login>

<script>
  const button = document.querySelector("np-email-login");
  button.email = "ada@lovelace.uk";
</script>
`;
```

Once the user clicks on this button, an email will be sent to its inbox.
By clicking on the received authorization link, he will be redirected to the original page with an extra `code` parameter.
This component will then automatically exchange it for an access token and emit it inside the `np:auth` event.

```html
<np-email-login></np-email-login>

<script>
  const button = document.querySelector("np-email-login");

  button.addEventListner("np:auth", (e) => {
    // Your user is authenticated ðŸŽ‰
    console.log(e.detail.token); // the access token
  });
</script>
```

> see the `np-email-login` specification for more info.

:::tip[Promote Passkeys]
Consider offering your users an even smoother and secure experience by letting them use Passkeys.
Passkeys use your fingerprint or other biometric to log you into your websites, just like unlocking your device.
See [Passkey Integration](passkeys) to learn more.

## You are done!

Transmit the access `token` to your backend to create the user's session. it can be verified with your own JWT library or using our own API endpoint.

See [token verification](tokens) to learn how to verify the `token`.
