Also known as a magic link, email authentication is a passwordless method where users log in by clicking a unique link sent to their email address.

## Add the `np-login` Input Component

From your login page, add the [`<np-login>`](/reference/components/np-login) component.

Once the user enters their email address and submits it, an authentication email is sent to that address.
By clicking the authorization link in the email, the user will be redirected to the original page with an additional `code` parameter.
The component will use this code to create the user session and emit a `np:login` event.

```js
const el = document.querySelector("np-login");

el.addEventListener("np:login", async (e) => {
  // A session has been created ðŸŽ‰
  const { expires_at, token } = await e.target.getSession();
});
```

## You Are Done!

Once the session is established, transmit the session token to your server and verify it.

import { LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Once the user is authenticated, consider offering an even smoother and more secure experience with Passkeys.
Passkeys use your fingerprint or other biometric data to log you into websites, just like unlocking your device.
