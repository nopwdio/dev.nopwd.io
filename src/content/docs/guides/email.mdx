Also known as a magic link, email authentication is a passwordless flow where users click a unique link sent to their email address to log in.

## Add the login with email button

From your login page, add the [`np-email-signin`](/reference/components/np-email-signin) component and set the `email` property with your user's email address.

```html
<np-email-signin></np-email-signin>

<script>
  const button = document.querySelector("np-email-signin");
  button.email = "ada@lovelace.uk";
</script>
```

Once the user clicks on this button, an email will be sent to its inbox.
By clicking on the received authorization link, he will be redirected to the original page with an extra `code` parameter.
This component will then automatically exchange it for an access token and emit it inside the `np:auth` event.

```html
<np-email-signin></np-email-signin>

<script>
  const button = document.querySelector("np-email-signin");

  button.addEventListner("np:auth", (e) => {
    // Your user is authenticated ðŸŽ‰
    console.log(e.detail.token); // the access token
  });
</script>
```
