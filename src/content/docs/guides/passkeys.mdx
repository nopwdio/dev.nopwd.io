Based on FIDO Alliance and **W3C standards**, Passkeys are a safer and easier alternative to passwords.
With passkeys, users can sign in to apps and websites with a biometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern, freeing them from having to remember and manage passwords.

Passkeys are:

- **easier** - users can select an account to sign in with biometric sensor.
- **safer** - passkeys are proven to be resistant to phishing, credential stuffing, and other remote attacks.

:::caution[Browsers support]
Passkeys is fully supported by Safari since `â‰¥16.6` but not for Chrome at this moment:
Conditional UI (a way to display a passkey from a login form) is not triggered when used inside a custom element [bug here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1404106).

## (1/3) Creating a passkey

Before asking your user to create a Passkey you need to make sure that their browsers are compatible.
The `np:auth` event emitted from the email authentication [`<np-email-login>`](/reference/components/np-email-login) compontent contains a `suggest_passkeys` attribute.
It is set to `true` if the user's browser support Passkeys. Use it to suggest a passkey creation process only for compatible browsers.

To create a passkey, just add the [`<np-passkey-register>`](/reference/components/np-passkey-register) component and set the `token` attribute from the authenticated user.

```html
<np-passkey-register></np-passkey-register>

<script type="module">
  // If you use CDN, ensure the component is loaded before interacting with it.
  await customElements.whenDefined("np-passkey-register");

  // set the token property with the user's access token
  const el = document.querySelector("np-passkey-register");
  el.token = "...";
</script>
`;
```

:::tip[How to import this component?]
You can import it with CDN or NPM. [Learn more](/reference/components).
:::

Once the user clicks on this button, the browser will prompt the user to create a passkey.
This component will then emit a `np:register` event when created.

```js
el.addEventListner("np:register", (e) => {
  // The passkey has been created ðŸŽ‰
  console.log(e.detail.id); // the passkey id.
});
```

This event contains the passkey `id`. It can be used to perform further optional administration operations such as revokation.

## (2/3) Authenticating with Passkeys

Just add the [`<np-passkey-login>`](/reference/components/np-passkey-login) component to your login page.
When focused by the user, it displays the created passkey for your website and perform authentification flow when selected.

```html
<np-passkey-login></np-passkey-login>

<script type="module">
  // listen to the 'np:auth' event
  const el = document.querySelector("np-passkey-login");

  el.addEventListner("np:auth", (e) => {
    // Your user is authenticated ðŸŽ‰
    console.log(e.detail.token); // the access token
  });
</script>
```

**What if the user didn't create a passkey yet?**

Don't worry! In that case, this component will simply act as a classic email input element for users without a Passkey.
You can use it as an email input to pass the email value to the [`<np-email-login>`](/reference/components/np-email-login) component to fallback to the email link authentication flow.

## (3/3) You are done!

Transmit the access `token` to your backend to create the user's session. it can be verified with your own JWT library or using our own API endpoint.
