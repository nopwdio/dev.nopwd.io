Based on FIDO Alliance and **W3C standards**, Passkeys are a safer and easier alternative to passwords.
With passkeys, users can sign in to apps and websites with a biometric sensor (such as a fingerprint or facial recognition), PIN, or pattern, freeing them from having to remember and manage passwords.

Passkeys are:

- **easier** - users can select an account to sign in with biometric sensor.
- **safer** - passkeys are proven to be resistant to phishing, credential stuffing, and other remote attacks.

## Browser limitations
When adding support for WebAuthn, special considerations must be made for browsers as it is still an "emerging" technology.

:::caution[Safari]
Passkeys are fully supported by Safari since `â‰¥16.6` but in some cases, registration may fail if a conditional UI has been already started.
This could lead to an "NotAllowedError" if the current page hasn't been reloaded: [learn more](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=257176). [A pull request](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/22983) has been proposed and is waiting to be merged.

:::caution[Chrome]
Conditional UI (a way to display a passkey from a login form) is not triggered when used inside a custom element [bug here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1404106) and [here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1505191).

## Creating a passkey

Before asking your user to create a Passkey you need to make sure that their browsers are compatible.
The `np:login` event emitted from the email authentication [`<np-email-auth>`](/reference/components/np-email-auth) compontent contains a `suggest_passkeys` attribute.
It is set to `true` if the user's browser support Passkeys. Use it to suggest a passkey creation process only for compatible browsers.

To create a passkey, just add the [`<np-passkey-register>`](/reference/components/np-passkey-register) component.

Once the user clicks on this button, the browser will prompt the user to create a passkey.
This component will then emit a `np:register` event when created.

```html
<np-passkey-register></np-passkey-register>

<script type="module">
  // If you use CDN, ensure the component is loaded before interacting with it.
  await customElements.whenDefined("np-passkey-register");

  el.addEventListner("np:register", (e) => {
    // The passkey has been created ðŸŽ‰
    const { id } = e.detail; // the passkey id.
  });
</script>
`;
```

This `np:register` event contains the passkey `id`. It can be used to perform further optional administration operations such as revokation.

## Authenticating with Passkeys

Just add the [`<np-passkey-conditional>`](/reference/components/np-passkey-conditional) component to your login page.
When focused by the user, this input element displays the created passkey for your website and perform authentification flow when selected.

```html
<np-passkey-conditional></np-passkey-conditional>

<script type="module">
  // listen to the 'np:auth' event
  const el = document.querySelector("np-passkey-conditional");

  el.addEventListner("np:login", (e) => {
  // a session has been created ðŸŽ‰
  const { expires_at, token } = e.detail;
  });
</script>
```

**What if the user didn't create a passkey yet?**

Don't worry! In that case, the `np-passkey-conditional` component will simply act as a classic email input element for users without a Passkey.
You can use it as an email input to pass the email value to the [`<np-email-auth>`](/reference/components/np-email-auth) component to fallback to the email link authentication flow.


## You are done!

Once the session established, you only have to transmit the session token to your server and verify it.
