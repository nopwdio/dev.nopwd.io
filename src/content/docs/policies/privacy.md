Your privacy is important to us. We collect personal information only when necessary to provide our services. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") details our privacy practices and how you can exercise your rights under this Policy and the privacy legislation applicable in your jurisdiction.

## Information We Collect and Store

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide certain personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:
(a) Email address
(b) IP address

We collect basic personal information like names and email addresses to identify and communicate with you. When you subscribe to any paid tier of our service, we collect additional personal information for billing purposes, such as company names, billing addresses, and payment methods. All sensitive billing information, like credit card numbers, is passed to Stripe, our Payment Card Industry (PCI) Standard compliant payment processor, for further processing.
We collect technical information like your browser, device, IP address, and operating system to facilitate troubleshooting, enhance security, discover bugs, report crashes, and perform other diagnostic activities. We also collect information about how you interact with our website, such as your referral source, which pages you viewed, and whether you encountered any errors, to facilitate product development, analytics, and personalization.
We never intentionally collect what we consider to be sensitive information, including race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, medical conditions, passport numbers, or other similar data.

## Communications

We use your contact information to communicate with you about our services, such as account, billing, and security notifications, and occasional product updates or announcements. You may choose to stop receiving communications, except for certain important billing notifications, by signing in and reviewing your notification preferences or by contacting us.

## Keeping Your Data Safe

We take security very seriously. We have strict access controls on your data to ensure only select employees can review service data for valid business needs, such as providing customer service and evaluating service performance and use. We do everything we can within commercially acceptable means, including utilizing firewalls, cryptographic techniques, nondisclosure agreements, and other standard measures, to protect your personal information from loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.

## Your Responsibilities

When you use our services, we verify your identity by sending a code (and link) via email and SMS or phone call (if applicable). For your protection, you should ensure that your email accounts and phones (if applicable) are secure and accessible only to you. The security of your account depends in part on how secure your emails and phones (if applicable) are.

## Your Rights

You have the right to request access to personal information we hold about you, request that we correct, update, or delete your personal information, revoke consent to being contacted by email or any other means of communication, and opt-out of any and all marketing communications. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us through the contact information below.

## International Transfers (GDPR)

Our services are managed by our team in France.
We use third-party service providers for the networking, infrastructure, and software services necessary to deliver our services to you. These third-party providers may process and store your personal data outside of the EEA and Switzerland, including in Canada and the US. We rely on adequacy when data is sent to Canada, and registration in the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield when data is sent to the US, to ensure that your personal information is lawfully transferred under EU law.

## Sub-processors (GDPR)

Our third-party sub-processors may have access to your personal information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf. They are obligated to not disclose or use your information for any other purpose and to maintain GDPR-compliant privacy practices.
